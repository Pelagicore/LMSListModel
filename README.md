This is a QML plugin for the Light Media Scanner. The plugin produces a list
model based on QAbstractListModel which allows querying for artists, albums,
etc.

The queries used by this project depend on the database schema from the GENIVI
Media Manager version of LMS, which includes album art in the database. See
here: https://github.com/Pelagicore/Media-Manager-lightmediascanner-patched

For a usage example, see main.qml.
